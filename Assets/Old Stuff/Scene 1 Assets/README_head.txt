In order to add a headshot to a textbox:
  1.  Set the base sprite in sprite renderer.
  2.  Set the animator to use in animator.
  3.  Make sure the render mode is on "Screen Space - Camera"
    3a. Set the render camera to Main Camera.
  4.  Type the talking emote value in the emotes list under the Canvas. The emote with that value
      will play on that page depending on their respective indices.
      4a. The amount of emotes MUST match the number of pages
      4b. The animation should be formatted so that the idle emote comes before the talking emote.
